			<h1>Pop Over</h1>
			<p>A <strong>popover</strong> is a small overlay that appears on top of the main content, typically used to display additional information or actions related to a specific element.</p>
			<p>With modern CSS, you can now create popovers natively using the <code>popover</code> attribute, without needing any JavaScript or external libraries. This makes popovers easier to implement, more accessible, and better integrated with browsers.</p>
			<p>Popovers are useful for notifications, tooltips, menus, or any UI element that needs to temporarily draw attention without navigating away from the current page.</p>
			<p>Click the button to open the popover. Click the button inside the popover to close it.</p>
			<p><strong>How is this different from a dialog?</strong> Unlike the <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element, which is typically modal and blocks interaction with the rest of the page, a popover is non-modal by default and is anchored to a specific element. Popovers allow users to continue interacting with the page outside the popover, making them ideal for lightweight, contextual UI elements.</p>
