	"name": "Theremin",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"description": "A playful, browser-based musical instrument that mimics the behavior of a classic Theremin. This project uses the Web Audio API to generate real-time sound based on pointer or touch position. Horizontal movement controls pitch (frequency), while vertical movement controls volume (amplitude)â€”just like a physical Theremin, but playable on any modern device with a screen."
