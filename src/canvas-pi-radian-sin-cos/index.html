				<h2>Snow (canvas)</h2>
				<p>This experiment involves a canvas element that adds a snow effect. It can be used as a full-screen effect or over specific sections like a hero image. While a snow effect is somewhat clich√©, it adds a wintry feel that can be especially appealing during the holiday season. However, snow doesn't fall simultaneously worldwide, so the effect might be out of place at times.</p>
				<h3>Practical Considerations</h3>
				<p>While the snow animation adds a magical touch, it can make text harder to read, as most animations do. It's advisable to include an option to turn off the effect or limit it to specific parts of your page to avoid accessibility issues.</p>
