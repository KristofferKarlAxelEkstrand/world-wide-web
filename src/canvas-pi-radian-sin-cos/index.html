				<p>This experiment uses a canvas element to generate a star effect, which can be applied as a full-screen background or over specific sections such as a hero image. It introduces a dynamic, atmospheric visual layer to the page.</p>
				<h3>Practical Considerations</h3>
				<p>The animation may reduce text readability. Consider allowing users to turn it off or limiting its use to specific areas of the page. Itâ€™s best reserved for very few times. This could ruin a page.</p>
